## Hill Climbing

This is a simple implementation of the algorithm, check this [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-hill-climbing-artificial-intelligence/) for more information on how the algorithm works.

## A* and Greedy Search

These were developed for the [Sliding Puzzle Solver](https://www.codewars.com/kata/sliding-puzzle-solver/train/python) kata from the [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) website.  
Although the greedy search with a simple heuristic does solve 3x3 and 4x4 puzzles, it does not solve harder ones.  
I'm still implementing a divide-and-conquer based heuristic that I discouvered [here](https://www.kopf.com.br/kaplof/how-to-solve-any-slide-puzzle-regardless-of-its-size/).
